Basic compiler for the Brainfuck language with object-oriented C++.

This program runs code written in Brainfuck language from the provided file,
with the output to the console. Seven out of eight BF commands are supported 
('+', '-', '<', '>', '[', ']', '.', with the exception of ','). 
All other characters in the file will be ignored, e.g. considered as comments. 
Commends must not include one of the seven special characters.

Test cases are taken from:

1/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
2/ https://github.com/kavehmz/brainfuck_examples

The compiling process is separated into two steps: creation of the actual model 
(vector of actions to run based on the BF code) and its execution.
